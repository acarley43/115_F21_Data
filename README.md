#### Motivation for data set
Mental health is something that will approximately affect over 50% of adults during their lives. When faced with mental health issues, most people will seek help. This can be known as mental health care. This heat map is based off observed phases conducted by the government during the COVID-19 pandemic.

#### Process used to clean
When looking through the data, I noticed that there were many errors that could be seen with missing values and rows saying that they were just completely unreliable. After making sure that any changes would not mess up the results, I decided to get rid of a couple of columns with data that did not help me understand the topic. I also got rid of the rows with no data entered and rows that were labelled as completely unreliable. After this step, I went on to analyze the data.
#### Analysis conclusions
My first step when it came to analyzing the data was looking at states individually at first.
