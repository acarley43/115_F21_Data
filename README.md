#### Processed Data Set

#### Motivation for data set
Mental health is something that will approximately affect over 50% of adults during their lives. When faced with mental health issues, most people will seek help. This can be known as mental health care. This heat map is based off observed phases conducted by the government during the COVID-19 pandemic.

#### Process Used to Clean
When looking through the data, I noticed that there were many errors that could be seen with missing values and rows saying that they were just completely unreliable. After making sure that any changes would not mess up the results, I decided to get rid of a couple of columns with data that did not help me understand the topic. I also got rid of the rows with no data entered and rows that were labelled as completely unreliable. After this step, I went on to analyze the data.
#### Analysis Conclusions
My first step when it came to analyzing the data was looking at the confidence intervals and seeing if the high and low intervals matched up.

After doing that, I decided to see if there were any obvious patterns between their phases and the confidence intervals.

#### Final Thoughts
When looking at the two images, I saw that there was only really one outlier in the data but I did not think that that mattered. The confidence intervals seemed to be pretty close to each other when it came to the average for high and low confidence intervals. This was interesting to me because it seemed that the amount of people receiving the care that they needed was not near as high as one thinks it should be. Considering how many factors there are in receiving any care, these findings did not shock me as much as I thought that they would. When running the numbers through a pivot table, it showed that when adding the sums of the highest and lowest confidence intervals, Utah,the District of Columbia, and Orgeon were the two states that seemed to be giving the best care to those that need it.Hawaii seeemd to be the state with the worst amount of health care.
